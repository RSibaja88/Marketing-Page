            <h1>FAQ's about AnywhereFitness</h1>
            <i><h3>Who created AnywhereFitness?</h3></i>
            <p>AnywhereFitness was created by LambdaSchool students in an effort to woo future employers and please their instructors.</p> <i><h3>Does AnywhereFitness charge my account monthly?</h3></i>
            <p>No, considering we are a mock application, that would be rather insidious. We're not psychopaths...</p>
            <i><h3>Who could benefit from AnywhereFitness?</h3></i>
            <p>Theoretically... anyone who wants to get fit, but wants to enjoy nature, the outdoors, and added socialization. Practically, the students who worked slaved away on their projects are the only ones who stand to benefit from this app.</p>
            <i><h3>Are there any age restrictions to join AnywhereFitness?</h3></i>
            <p>Of course not! But, if we were a live app there would most likely be an age restriction so bratty kids don't run up their parents credit card bills.</p>
            <i><h3>Who should join AnywhereFitness?</h3></i>
            <p>Droids, bots, whoever catchapas are gunning for, Sims, maybe Terminator?</p>
            <i><h3>Who shouldn't join AnywhereFitness?</h3></i>
            <p>Actual human beings. As in living, breathing people burdened with the weight of existence and crippled by festering solitude while imperviously meandering through this desolate wasteland we call society.</p>
